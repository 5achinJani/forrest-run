  "Forrest Gump: You died on a Saturday morning. And I had you placed here under our tree. And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground. Momma always said dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, he's doing just fine. About to start school again soon. I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day. Teaching him how to play ping-pong. He's really good. We fish a lot. And every night, we read a book. He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a letter, and he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you. Jenny, I don't know if Momma was right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny.

  "Forrest Gump: [Narrating] Remember how I told you that Jenny never seemed to wanted to go home? She lived in a house that was old as Alabama, her momma had gone up to heaven when she was five her daddy was some kind of farmer, he was a very loving man always kissing and touching her and her sisters then this one time Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school\n\n",
  "Forrest Gump: [Narrating] College ran by real fast because I played so much football they even put me on the All American team where you get to meet the President of the United States, some years later for no particular reason someone shot that nice young President when he was riding in his car and a few years after that somebody shot his brother too, only he was in the hotel kitchen, must be hard being brothers I wouldn't know\n\n",
  "Forrest Gump: [Narrating] Night time in the army was a lonely time. We lay there in our bunks and I'd miss my momma and I'd miss Jenny. Turns out Jenny had gotten into some trouble over some photos of her in her college sweater and she was thrown out of school but that wasn't a bad thing because a man who owns a theater in Memphis Tennessee saw those photos and offered Jenny a job singing in a show, the first chance I got I took a bus to Memphis to see her show.\n\n",

You know why we're a good partnership? Because we'd be watching out for each other, like brothers and stuff. There's something I've been thinking about, I got a very important question to ask you, how would you like to go into the shrimping business with me? I got it all figured out too so many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat, we don't have to pay any rent, I'll be the Captain and you can be the first mate. I'm telling you we'll split everything down the middle I'm telling you fifty, fifty and we'll have all the shrimp we can eat.\n\n",
  'Forrest Gump: [Narrating, while serving his tour of duty in Vietnam] I sent Jenny a letter not every day but almost. I told her what I was doing and asked her what she was doing. I told her how I thought about her. I was looking forward to getting a letter from her when she had time. I always let her know I was ok and I signed each letter "love Forest Gump."\n\n',
  "Forrest Gump: [Narrating] They told us Vietnam was going to be a lot different than United States of America. I got to see a lot of the country side. We would take these real long walks, the good thing about Vietnam, there was always some place to go and there was always something to do.\n\n",
  "Lieutenant Daniel Taylor: [to Forrest] We all have a destiny: nothing just happens, it's all part of a plan. I should have died out there with my men, now I'm nothing but a God damn cripple, a leg less freak, do you know what it's like not being able to use your legs? I had a destiny, I was supposed to die out there in the field with honor and you cheated me out of it. This wasn't supposed to happen to me\n\n",

  'Black Panther: [to Forrest and Jenny] Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders from racial onslaught from the "pig" who is brutalizing our people. We are here to offer protection and help for all those who need our help because we, the Black Panthers, are against the war in Vietnam. Yes we are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them. Yes we are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities as they sleep at night.\n\n',
  "Forrest Gump: [Narrating] I thought I was going back to Vietnam but instead they decided the best way for me to fight the Communists was to play ping pong, so I was in the Special Services, traveling around the country cheering up all the wounded veterans, showing them how to play ping pong. I was so good that some years later the army decided I should be on the All American Ping Pong Team. We were the first Americans to visit the land of China in a million years or something like that. Somebody said world peace was in our hands.\n\n",
  "Forrest Gump: [Narrating] We walked around all night: just Jenny and me. Just talking, she told me all the traveling she'd done, how she discovered ways to \"expand her mind and live in harmony,\" which must be out west or somewhere because she made it out to California. It was a very special night for the two of us. I didn't want it to end.\n\n",
  "Forrest Gump: [Referring to Jenny, narrating] and then she was there. She came back and stayed with me. Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go, or maybe it was because she was so tired because she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years. It was wonderful having her home: every day we'd take a walk and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree, she'd listen about ping ponging and shrimping and Momma making a trip up to heaven. I did most of the talking, most of the time she was real quiet, I really never knew why she came back but I didn't care it was like old times we were like peas and carrots again everyday. I'd pick pretty flowers and put it in her room for her. She even showed me how to dance, we were like family, it was the happiest time in my life\n\n",
